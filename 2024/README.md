- Problem: Calculate the total distance and similarity score between two lists of location IDs.
- Solution: Sorted both lists, computed distances between paired elements for the total distance, and multiplied elements by their occurrences for the similarity score.
- Keywords: sorting, pairing, hashmap, absolute difference, frequency count.

**Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports**

- Problem : Identify reports with strictly increasing or decreasing sequences of numbers with differences between 1 and 3.
- Solution : Evaluated each report for sequence trends and applied a condition to potentially exclude one outlier to deem a report safe.
- Keywords: sequences, validation, adjacent differences, conditional checks

**Day 3: Mull It Over**

- Problem: Parse and evaluate corrupted instructions to sum valid multiplications, considering conditional enable/disable logic.
- Solution: Use regex to extract valid mul operations, track state changes with do()/don't(), and sum enabled results.
- Keywords: regex, state management, conditional logic, parsing

**Day 4: Ceres Search**

- Problem: Count occurrences of "XMAS" in all orientations and identify "X-MAS" patterns in a grid.  
- Solution: Traverse grid using directional checks to match "XMAS" and intersecting "MAS" sequences.  
- Keywords: grid traversal, pattern matching, directional search, adjacency checks.
